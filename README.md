# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. It includes the basic configuration needed to start developing a React application using Vite.

## Official Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available for handling React with Vite:

1. **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
   
2. **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: This plugin uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gourav224/Ellty_Assignment
   cd Ellty_Assignment
   ```

2. Install Dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or if you prefer Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the Development Server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or with Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and open your application in the browser with Hot Module Replacement enabled.

4. Build for Production

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Or with Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   This will create a production-ready build of your application in the `dist` directory.
